// static_address_map.h: StaticAddressMap.
//
// StaticAddressMap is a wrapper class of StaticMap, just as AddressMap wraps
// std::map.  StaticAddressMap provides read-only Retrieve() operation, similar
// as AddressMap.  However, the difference between StaticAddressMap and
// AddressMap is that StaticAddressMap does not support dynamic operation
// Store() due to the static nature of the underlying StaticMap.
//
// See address_map.h for reference.
