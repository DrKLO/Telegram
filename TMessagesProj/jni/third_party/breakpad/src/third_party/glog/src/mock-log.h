// lifespan.  Using this together with Google C++ Mocking Framework,
// it's very easy to test how a piece of code calls LOG().  The
// typical usage:
//
//   TEST(FooTest, LogsCorrectly) {
//     ScopedMockLog log;
//
//     // We expect the WARNING "Something bad!" exactly twice.
//     EXPECT_CALL(log, Log(WARNING, _, "Something bad!"))
//         .Times(2);
//
//     // We allow foo.cc to call LOG(INFO) any number of times.
//     EXPECT_CALL(log, Log(INFO, HasSubstr("/foo.cc"), _))
//         .Times(AnyNumber());
//
//     Foo();  // Exercises the code under test.
//   }

  //
  // Note, that in a multi-threaded environment, all LOG() messages from a
  // single thread will be handled in sequence, but that cannot be guaranteed
  // for messages from different threads. In fact, if the same or multiple
  // expectations are matched on two threads concurrently, their actions will
  // be executed concurrently as well and may interleave.

  // Implements the send() virtual function in class LogSink.

  //
  // The method argument list is long and carries much information a
  // test usually doesn't care about, so we trim the list before
  // forwarding the call to Log(), which is much easier to use in
  // tests.
  //
  // We still cannot call Log() directly, as it may invoke other LOG()
  // messages, either due to Invoke, or due to an error logged in
  // Google C++ Mocking Framework code, which would trigger a deadlock
  // since a lock is held during send().
  //
  // Hence, we save the message for WaitTillSent() which will be called after
  // the lock on send() is released, and we'll call Log() inside
  // WaitTillSent(). Since while a single send() call may be running at a
  // time, multiple WaitTillSent() calls (along with the one send() call) may
  // be running simultaneously, we ensure thread-safety of the exchange between
  // send() and WaitTillSent(), and that for each message, LOG(), send(),
  // WaitTillSent() and Log() are executed in the same thread.
