# ghash-ssse3-x86.pl is a constant-time variant of the traditional 4-bit
# table-based GHASH implementation. It requires SSSE3 instructions.
#
# For background, the table-based strategy is a 4-bit windowed multiplication.
# It precomputes all 4-bit multiples of H (this is 16 128-bit rows), then loops
# over 4-bit windows of the input and indexes them up into the table. Visually,
# it multiplies as in the schoolbook multiplication diagram below, but with
# more terms. (Each term is 4 bits, so there are 32 terms in each row.) First
# it incorporates the terms labeled '1' by indexing the most significant term
# of X into the table. Then it shifts and repeats for '2' and so on.
#
#        hhhhhh
#  *     xxxxxx
#  ============
#        666666
#       555555
#      444444
#     333333
#    222222
#   111111
#
# This implementation changes the order. We treat the table as a 16Ã—16 matrix
# and transpose it. The first row is then the first byte of each multiple of H,
# and so on. We then reorder terms as below. Observe that the terms labeled '1'
# and '2' are all lookups into the first row, etc. This maps well to the SSSE3
# pshufb instruction, using alternating terms of X in parallel as indices. This
# alternation is needed because pshufb maps 4 bits to 8 bits. Then we shift and
# repeat for each row.
#
#        hhhhhh
#  *     xxxxxx
#  ============
#        224466
#       113355
#      224466
#     113355
#    224466
#   113355
#
# Next we account for GCM's confusing bit order. The "first" bit is the least
# significant coefficient, but GCM treats the most sigificant bit within a byte
# as first. Bytes are little-endian, and bits are big-endian. We reverse the
# bytes in XMM registers for a consistent bit and byte ordering, but this means
# the least significant bit is the most significant coefficient and vice versa.
#
# For consistency, "low", "high", "left-shift", and "right-shift" refer to the
# bit ordering within the XMM register, rather than the reversed coefficient
# ordering. Low bits are less significant bits and more significant
# coefficients. Right-shifts move from MSB to the LSB and correspond to
# increasing the power of each coefficient.
#
# Note this bit reversal enters into the table's column indices. H*1 is stored
# in column 0b1000 and H*x^3 is stored in column 0b0001. It also means earlier
# table rows contain more significant coefficients, so we iterate forwards.
