This directory consumes tools from other repositories for use on the
bots. For a similarly-configured local checkout for testing, run:

   mkdir boringssl-gclient
   cd boringssl-gclient
   gclient config --unmanaged --deps-file=util/bot/DEPS https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/
   gclient sync

To update to newer revisions, follow these instructions:

DEPS: Set all revisions to those used in Chromium, found at
   https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/DEPS (Search for the
   corresponding repository name.)

go/bootstrap.py: Set TOOLSET_VERSION to the latest release of Go, found at
    https://golang.org/dl/.

update_clang.py: Set CLANG_REVISION and CLANG_SUB_REVISION to the values used in
    Chromium, found at
    https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/tools/clang/scripts/update.py

vs_toolchain.py: Update _GetDesiredVsToolchainHashes from Chromium, found at
    https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/build/vs_toolchain.py
    This may require taking other updates to that file. (Don't remove MSVC
    versions if BoringSSL still needs to support them.)

The .sha1 files correspond to files downloaded from Google Cloud Storage. To
update, place the updated files in their intended location and run:

    upload_to_google_storage.py -b chromium-tools FILE
