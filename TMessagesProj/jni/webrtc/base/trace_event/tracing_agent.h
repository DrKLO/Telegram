  // function call without any cross-thread or cross-process activity. However,
  // tracing agents in Chrome run in their own threads. Therefore, the issuer
  // needs to dedicate the 2nd task to the receiver to take time measurements
  // in the receiver thread, and the receiver thread needs to pass them back to
  // the issuer in the callback.
