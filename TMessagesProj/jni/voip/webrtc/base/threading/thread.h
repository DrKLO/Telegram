// IMPORTANT: Instead of creating a base::Thread, consider using

//
// A simple thread abstraction that establishes a MessageLoop on a new thread.
// The consumer uses the MessageLoop of the thread to cause code to execute on
// the thread.  When this object is destroyed the thread is terminated.  All
// pending tasks queued on the thread's message loop will run to completion
// before the thread is terminated.
//
// WARNING! SUBCLASSES MUST CALL Stop() IN THEIR DESTRUCTORS!  See ~Thread().
//
// After the thread is stopped, the destruction sequence is:
//
//  (1) Thread::CleanUp()
//  (2) MessageLoop::~MessageLoop
//  (3.b) MessageLoopCurrent::DestructionObserver::WillDestroyCurrentMessageLoop
//
// This API is not thread-safe: unless indicated otherwise its methods are only
// valid from the owning sequence (which is the one from which Start() is
// invoked -- should it differ from the one on which it was constructed).
//
// Sometimes it's useful to kick things off on the initial sequence (e.g.
// construction, Start(), task_runner()), but to then hand the Thread over to a
// pool of users for the last one of them to destroy it when done. For that use
// case, Thread::DetachFromSequence() allows the owning sequence to give up
// ownership. The caller is then responsible to ensure a happens-after
// relationship between the DetachFromSequence() call and the next use of that
// Thread object (including ~Thread()).
