// Implements 16-bit mono PCM audio output support for Android using the
// C based OpenSL ES API. No calls from C/C++ to Java using JNI is done.
//
// An instance can be created on any thread, but must then be used on one and
// the same thread. All public methods must also be called on the same thread. A
// thread checker will RTC_DCHECK if any method is called on an invalid thread.
// Decoded audio buffers are requested on a dedicated internal thread managed by
// the OpenSL ES layer.
//
// The existing design forces the user to call InitPlayout() after Stoplayout()
// to be able to call StartPlayout() again. This is inline with how the Java-
// based implementation works.
//
// OpenSL ES is a native C API which have no Dalvik-related overhead such as
// garbage collection pauses and it supports reduced audio output latency.
// If the device doesn't claim this feature but supports API level 9 (Android
// platform version 2.3) or later, then we can still use the OpenSL ES APIs but
// the output latency may be higher.
