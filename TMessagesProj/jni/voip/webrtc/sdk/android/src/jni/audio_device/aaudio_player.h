// Implements low-latency 16-bit mono PCM audio output support for Android
// using the C based AAudio API.
//
// An instance must be created and destroyed on one and the same thread.
// All public methods must also be called on the same thread. A thread checker
// will DCHECK if any method is called on an invalid thread. Audio buffers
// are requested on a dedicated high-priority thread owned by AAudio.
//
// The existing design forces the user to call InitPlayout() after StopPlayout()
// to be able to call StartPlayout() again. This is in line with how the Java-
// based implementation works.
//
// An audio stream can be disconnected, e.g. when an audio device is removed.
// This implementation will restart the audio stream using the new preferred
// device if such an event happens.
//
// Also supports automatic buffer-size adjustment based on underrun detections
// where the internal AAudio buffer can be increased when needed. It will
// reduce the risk of underruns (~glitches) at the expense of an increased
// latency.
