// VoipBase interface
//
// VoipBase provides a management interface on a media session using a
// concept called 'channel'.  A channel represents an interface handle
// for application to request various media session operations.  This
// notion of channel is used throughout other interfaces as well.
//
// Underneath the interface, a channel id is mapped into an audio session
// object that is capable of sending and receiving a single RTP stream with
// another media endpoint.  It's possible to create and use multiple active
// channels simultaneously which would mean that particular application
// session has RTP streams with multiple remote endpoints.
//
// A typical example for the usage context is outlined in VoipEngine
// header file.
