To build libevent, type

$ ./configure && make

     (If you got libevent from the subversion repository, you will
      first need to run the included "autogen.sh" script in order to
      generate the configure script.)

Install as root via

# make install

You can run the regression tests by

$ make verify

Before, reporting any problems, please run the regression tests.

To enable the low-level tracing build the library as:

CFLAGS=-DUSE_DEBUG ./configure [...]
