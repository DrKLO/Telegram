 * A sink that consumes audio data.

 * <p>Before starting playback, specify the input audio format by calling {@link #configure(int,

 *
 * <p>Call {@link #handleBuffer(ByteBuffer, long)} to write data, and {@link #handleDiscontinuity()}
 * when the data being fed is discontinuous. Call {@link #play()} to start playing the written data.
 *
 * <p>Call {@link #configure(int, int, int, int, int[], int, int)} whenever the input format
 * changes. The sink will be reinitialized on the next call to {@link #handleBuffer(ByteBuffer,
 * long)}.
 *
 * <p>Call {@link #flush()} to prepare the sink to receive audio data from a new playback position.
 *
 * <p>Call {@link #playToEndOfStream()} repeatedly to play out all data when no more input buffers
 * will be provided via {@link #handleBuffer(ByteBuffer, long)} until the next {@link #flush()}.
 * Call {@link #reset()} when the instance is no longer required.
 *
 * <p>The implementation may be backed by a platform {@link AudioTrack}. In this case, {@link
 * #setAudioSessionId(int)}, {@link #setAudioAttributes(AudioAttributes)}, {@link
 * #enableTunnelingV21(int)} and/or {@link #disableTunneling()} may be called before writing data to
 * the sink. These methods may also be called after writing data to the sink, in which case it will
 * be reinitialized as required. For implementations that are not based on platform {@link
 * AudioTrack}s, calling methods relating to audio sessions, audio attributes, and tunneling may
