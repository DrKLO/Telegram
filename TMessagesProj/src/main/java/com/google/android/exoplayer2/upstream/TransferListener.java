/**
 * A listener of data transfer events.
 *
 * <p>A transfer usually progresses through multiple steps:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Initializing the underlying resource (e.g. opening a HTTP connection). {@link
 *       #onTransferInitializing(DataSource, DataSpec, boolean)} is called before the initialization
 *       starts.
 *   <li>Starting the transfer after successfully initializing the resource. {@link
 *       #onTransferStart(DataSource, DataSpec, boolean)} is called. Note that this only happens if
 *       the initialization was successful.
 *   <li>Transferring data. {@link #onBytesTransferred(DataSource, DataSpec, boolean, int)} is
 *       called frequently during the transfer to indicate progress.
 *   <li>Closing the transfer and the underlying resource. {@link #onTransferEnd(DataSource,
 *       DataSpec, boolean)} is called. Note that each {@link #onTransferStart(DataSource, DataSpec,
 *       boolean)} will have exactly one corresponding call to {@link #onTransferEnd(DataSource,
 *       DataSpec, boolean)}.
