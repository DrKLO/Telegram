 * version is that no explicit tag is used, and clients are expected to use 'instanceof' to find the
 * right subclass of the buffer. This allows clients to create custom VideoFrame.Buffer in
 * arbitrary format in their custom VideoSources, and then cast it back to the correct subclass in
 * their custom VideoSinks. All implementations must also implement the toI420() function,
 * converting from the underlying representation if necessary. I420 is the most widely accepted
 * format and serves as a fallback for video sinks that can only handle I420, e.g. the internal
 * WebRTC software encoders.
