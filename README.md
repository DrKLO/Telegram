### Translation

Sirs translators, It was becoming impossible to manage all pull requests regarding translations. This was also taking the precious time to fix bugs. A translated program is good, but is better a program with less or no bugs, and more features. We decided then, fully migrate any translation effort to Transifex translation platform. 

The Transifex platform makes it much simpler to manage groups of translations and translations, and has several well useful tools for this purpose. 

We thank everyone for their arduous effort.

See [Telegram] (http://telegram.org) translation project on Transifex platform here:

If your language is not yet available, make the request for inclusion in [Transifex.com platform] (Https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/telegram)

All pull requests on GitHub, regarding translations will not be accepted.
