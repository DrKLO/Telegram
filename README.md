## Telegraher

* **No one gets to decide** what i run on my device
* **No one gets to decide** where i run my app
* **No one gets to decide** what must be deleted

> This is my device so i control it 😎

> This app have nothing with privacy, it's remotely controlled. It's pissing me off, so i changed
> that.

> I took an original Telegram client from ["official" repo](https://github.com/DrKLO/Telegram) and
> made my own theme park with blackjack and hoookers.

**Special thanks**:

* my wife and my dog, love them 🍑
* mr Rodríguez for the inspiration
* some anonymous folks over the telegram for the great ideas (can't share their names here, cause
  they are anonymous)
* "Telegram🦄magic🦄team" for their "magic🦄updates" including ~~private~~ chats and "magic🦄ads"

### WTF?! / is it legit?

Follow the ~~white rabbit~~ the git flow:

* i took and forked the original client
* i cloned the latest `master` branch (with 8.3.1 patch) into `master_8.3.1`
* i made another branch `noshit_8.3.1` from `master_8.3.1`, it contain changes

It gives us `telegram` -> `master` -> `master_8.3.1` -> `noshit_8.3.1`

So **all the code changes** are in `noshit_8.3.1` (when this project started, actual version is
different)
